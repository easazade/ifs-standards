## About IFS (Individual Freedom System)

**System Philosophy:** The IFS is a "Servant-Architecture" for governance. It operates on the principle that sovereignty is non-transferable. Power resides permanently with the individual and is only temporarily delegated to roles or entities.

**Dynamic Role Delegation:** Unlike static elected terms, IFS enables Real-time Authority Revocation. Users do not "elect" leaders; they assign specific responsibilities to "Stewards" whose permissions can be modified or terminated instantly by the affected collective.

**Proportional Governance (The Scope Rule):** Decision-making power is strictly limited to the affected radius. If a decision impacts a town, only that town's participants possess the voting keys. If it impacts a nation, the keys scale accordingly.

**Radical Transparency & Fiscal Agency:** Every resource flow is indexed and public. "Taxation" is replaced by Direct Resource Allocation—users do not pay into a black box; they programmatically direct their contributions to specific services and can audit every transaction in real-time.

## About This Project:

**IFS Standards:** This repository defines schemas, protocols, rules for Dynamic Consent, Asset Traceability, and Modular Rule-Setting, providing the protocols to instantiate a friction-less, transparent society. These Standards can be used and followed to implement a software system.

## Source of truth

- Product feature requirements live in `specs/<feature>/<requirement-type>.md`.
  - requirement can be types are usually `ui`, `data`, `logic` or etc
- UI rules live in `DESIGN.md`
- Design files live in `design/` as .pen files created by pencil.dev which is a design as code tool. design files can be modified via pencil mcp by agents they must follow `DESIGN.md` guidelines

## Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` - Production build to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` - Serve production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format with Prettier

Here is the compressed, low-entropy version of your rules. I have stripped the conversational "fluff," combined related instructions, and used concise "caveman-style" directives to minimize token usage while maintaining intent.

## Key Files

- **Entry**: `src/main.jsx` - React app with BrowserRouter
- **Routes**: `src/routes.js` - Route definitions
- **Data**: `src/data/protocols.js` - Protocol data source
- **Layout**: `src/layouts/MainLayout.jsx` - Navbar + Sidebar wrapper

## Notes

- Tailwind v4 uses `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (not the old postcss approach)
- GSAP animations via `@gsap/react` hook
- No tests configured


## Rules (IMPORTANT)

### Read Rules First

- At start of each conversation, read AGENTS.md.
- Identify rules with `alwaysApply: true` — these MUST be followed.
- Identify rules with `alwaysApply: false` — follow intelligently if rule applies to task.
- alwaysApply: true

### React/JS Learning (Intelligent)

- Teach React & Advanced JS.
- Update `NOTES.md`: Include TOC with links, sections for new concepts.
- Coding: Add short comments above new concepts/types.
- Reference: Use Flutter/Dart analogies.
- Discretion: Decide if `NOTES.md` entry, code comment, or both is required.
- alwaysApply: false

### Trace & Report

- End every response with:

```
## Trace
- Rules used:
- Skills/Tools:
- Assumptions:
- (Use "unknown" if unsure; keep concise)
- alwaysApply: true
```

### Optimization

- Use caveman skill: Shorten prompts, minimize context/cost unless forbidden.
- alwaysApply: true

### Script Recommendations

- At each run start, briefly review `scripts/script-recommendations.md`
- When encountering tasks that are context-heavy, tedious, or token-costly, document the pattern there with: task description, why costly, potential solution
- Do NOT auto-implement - flag for discussion
- Only suggest scripts that meet criteria: likely 5%+ token savings, no negative effect on task quality
- alwaysApply: true

### Design & Pencil MCP

- Use `DESIGN.md` for all tasks in `design/` (e.g., .pen files).
- pencil mcp: main design tool
- .pen rules: No helper files/scripts/temp artifacts. No retries via scripts.
- .lib.pen files are shared pencil libraries that must be imported into all .pen files in the design/ dir
- Colors: Use HEX only. No RGBA.
- Design Tokens & Components: Source of truth is `design-system.lib.pen`
- run `node scripts/tokens-to-code.mjs` to regenerate index.css base on design tokens
- Design to Code: only tailwind inline css classes (existing classes), Use defined variables, no hardcoding
- alwaysApply: false
